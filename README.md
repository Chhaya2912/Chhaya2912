I am a computer science and engineering engineering student. I am from Roorkee, and I graduated from ASASVM, Roorkee, with a high school diploma and an intermediate diploma. I'm always keen to learn anything new. Learning new languages is a pastime of mine. Hindi is my first language. I can also communicate in English and Sanskrit.
